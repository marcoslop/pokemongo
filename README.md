# pokemongo

Scripts with utilities to be used in Pokemon Go (src/main/java/com/pokescripts/scripts)

- List all your pokemons
- Rename all your pokemons to {PokemonType}{IV}
- Transfer all your pokemons and remain only the ones that have a IV higher than 80, and we always remain the best
pokemon of each type.

Based in https://github.com/Grover-c13/PokeGOAPI-Java

First time you execute any of the scripts, a token from Google will be asked. This refresh token will be saved in a txt
file and in next executions it wonÂ´t be able to enter it again.
