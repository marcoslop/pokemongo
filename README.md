# pokemongo

Scripts with utilities to be used in Pokemon Go (src/main/java/com/pokescripts/scripts)

- List all your pokemons
- Rename all your pokemons to {PokemonType}{IV}
- Transfer all your pokemons and remain only the ones that have a IV higher than 80, and we always remain the best
pokemon of each type.
